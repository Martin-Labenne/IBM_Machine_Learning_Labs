In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n","\n","\n","### Recall linear regression:\n","\n","As you know, **Linear regression** finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, **y**, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n","\n","$$\n","y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 + \\cdots\n","$$\n","\n","and finds the values of parameters $\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2$, etc, where the term $\\theta_0$ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n","\n","$$\n","‚Ñé_\\theta(ùë•) = \\theta^TX\n","$$\n","\n","\n","Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, used when the observed dependent variable, <b>y</b>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n","\n","Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression function and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called the sigmoid function ùúé:\n","\n","$$\n","‚Ñé_\\theta(ùë•) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 +\\cdots)}}\n","$$\n","Or:\n","$$\n","ProbabilityOfaClass_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^TX}}{1+e^{\\theta^TX}} \n","$$\n","\n","In this equation, ${\\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\sigma(\\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n","\n","So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/mod_ID_24_final.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n","\n","\n","The objective of the __Logistic Regression__ algorithm, is to find the best parameters Œ∏, for $‚Ñé_\\theta(ùë•)$ = $\\sigma({\\theta^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"66af3bd6-edeb-4ddf-be27-c367fa68db44","metadata":{},"source":["### Customer churn with Logistic Regression\n","A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
